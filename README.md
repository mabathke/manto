# Manto - Game App
Manto is a web application designed to offer a variety of games that users can enjoy with their friends. This project is still in development, and its long-term goal is to provide an engaging, multiplayer experience that includes real-time gameplay features.

The core aim of this project is to serve as a learning platform for enhancing my full-stack development skills, with a particular focus on using TypeScript across both the frontend and backend. By building this app, Iâ€™m gaining practical experience with modern web technologies and deepening my understanding of concepts like user authentication, state management, and game logic implementation. In the future, I plan to integrate real-time multiplayer functionality using technologies like WebSockets, allowing for more dynamic and interactive gameplay experiences.

## First Game: Multiplayer Quiz
The first game that will be introduced on the platform is a multiplayer quiz game inspired by the Finto Quiz App. Players will be able to join a lobby where they can invite friends to participate. Once the lobby is full, players will compete by answering quiz questions, with scores tracked in real-time. This quiz game will serve as the foundation for more complex games in the future and will allow me to explore multiplayer dynamics and real-time interactions in the app.
